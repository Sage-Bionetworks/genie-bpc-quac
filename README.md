# GENIE BPC Quality Assurance Checklist

## Overview

This repository provides a command line tool for checking raw data, intermediate files, and final data releases for the GENIE Biopharma Collaborative (BPC) project.  

## Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:hhunterzinck/genie-bpc-quac.git
cd genie-bpc-quac/
```

For installation with Docker: 

```
docker build -t genie-bpc-quac .
```

For install without Docker, install Synapser and other required packages:
```
R -e 'install.packages("synapser", repos = c("http://ran.synapse.org", "http://cran.fhcrc.org"))'
R -e 'renv::restore()'
```

## Usage 

Make sure to cache your Synapse personal access token (PAT) as an environmental variable:

```
export SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN={your_personal_access_token_here}
```

To run with Docker:

```
docker run --rm genie-bpc-quac -h
```

To run without Docker:

```
Rscript genie-bpc-quac.R -h
```

The command line interface will display as follows: 

```
usage: genie-bpc-quac.R [-h] -c {BLADDER,BrCa,CRC,NSCLC,PANC,Prostate}
                        [-s {all,DFCI,MSK,UHN,VICC}] -r
                        {comparison,masking,release,table,upload} [-n NUMBER]
                        [-l {all,error,warning}] [-o] [-u] [-v]
                        [-a SYNAPSE_AUTH]

  -r {comparison,masking,release,table,upload}
                        Report to generate
  -n NUMBER             Reference number of check to run individually within
                        report

                        performed but do not execute
  -u                    Save report log file to pre-specified Synapse folder
  -v                    Display messages on script progress to the user
  -a SYNAPSE_AUTH       Path to .synapseConfig file or Synapse PAT (default:
                        '~/.synapseConfig')
```

Example command line with Docker:

```
docker run --rm genie-bpc-quac -c {cohort} -s {site} -r upload -l error -v -a $SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN

## Adding new QA checks

The QuAC framework is built in modular units for extensibility.  If a new QA check needs to be added, implement the following steps:

1. In the `config.yaml` under the `checks` key, add another element using the next available index number.  The check element metadata should consist of the following information: 
```
checks:
  {check_no}:
      implemented: {0 or 1 to indicate whether the check is currently implemented}
      deprecated: {0 or 1 to indicate whether the check is currently deprecated}
      level: {error, warning, or fail to indicate check level}
      label: {label for the check that should match the function name implementing the check}
      description: {human-readable description of what the check is examining}
      action: {human-readable description of the request to fix the issue detected by the check}
```

2. In `checklist.R`, implement the check as a function with the following format:
```
{label} <- function(cohort, site, report, output_format = "log") {
  output <- NULL
  {implementation}
  output <- format_output({values}, 
                            cohort = cohort, 
                            site = site,
                            output_format = output_format,
                            column_name = {column_name}, 
                            synid = {file synapse id},
                            check_no = {check_no},
                            infer_site = F)
  return(output)
}
```

3. Add the `check_no` to appopriate report check list `config.yaml` under the `report` key.  

The above steps will incorporate the novel check into the program when the user requests the respective `report` and `level`.
